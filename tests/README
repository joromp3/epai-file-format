This directory contains some basic sample files to use for testing.

unc.epai:
	A valid file containing a simple static image with pixel format
	A1R4G4B4, with padding and text metadata. The image is uncompressed
	(algorithm "COPY") and unfiltered (filter 0x00 on all scanlines).
unc-nopadd.epai:
	Same, without the padding.
unc-stripped.epai:
	Same, with no padding and no metadata; only mandatory sections.
paddonly.epai:
	A file containing only padding. Invalid (no images) but useful for
	testing.
metadata-test.epai:
	A file containing just a valid metadata section and some padding.
	File invalid (no images) but useful for preliminary testing.
